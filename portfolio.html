    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I am a hard-working, goal-oriented, and a team player currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications degree at PSGR Krishnammal College for Women, where I have built a foundation in programming languages including C++, Python, Java, and Database Management Systems. 
            I am a versatile professional with strong problem-solving abilities, a proven track record of adaptability in dynamic environments, and excellent time management skills. My ability to build strong interpersonal relationships complements my knack for multi-tasking efficiently. Along with my technical expertise in coding, I thrive in collaborative settings, always aiming to deliver innovative solutions.

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Mini-project - Electricity Billing Management System</h3>
            <p>For this mini-project, I developed an Electricity Billing Management System using SQL. The system automates the entire billing process by tracking monthly electricity consumption and calculating the cost per unit of electricity. I utilized key DBMS techniques including DDL (Data Definition Language) for structuring the database, DML (Data Manipulation Language) for data retrieval and modification, DCL (Data Control Language) for managing access controls, and TCL (Transaction Control Language) to ensure data consistency and integrity. This project efficiently manages data flow, ensuring accurate billing and streamlined operations.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Internship Project - An android app for School Child Monitoring Sstem</h3>
            <p>For my internship project, I developed an android app for School Child Monitoring System using Java and XML as front-end and SQLite as back-end. This project aims to enhance student safety and improve communication between schools and parents. The primary purpose of this application is to keep parents informed about their childâ€™s school attendance in real-time, without tracking the child's location through GPS. By implementing QR code scanning at the school gate, parents are notified when their child arrives and leaves school, thus ensuring peace of mind and enhancing child safety.</p>
